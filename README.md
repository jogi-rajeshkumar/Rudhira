# 🩸 Rudhira – Blood Donation App (🚧 Under Development)

Hi, I'm currently working on **Rudhira**, a mobile-first blood donation application designed to make the donation and request process smoother, faster, and more accessible. The main goal is to connect **donors** and **recipients** in real-time using location, medical eligibility, and chat-based interactions — all while maintaining user privacy and consent.

---

## 📖 Project Objective

This project is close to my heart — I wanted to create a platform where people in urgent need of blood can easily reach out to donors who are medically eligible and available nearby. Rudhira aims to:

- Digitize the blood donation workflow
- Improve emergency request fulfillment
- Encourage regular donations via scheduling and reminders
- Enable trusted chat communication between verified users

---

## 🚀 Key Features (Work in Progress)

- 🔐 Secure login & OTP-based signup
- 👤 User profile with medical eligibility info
- 📍 Real-time donor-recipient map matching
- 💬 In-app chat system
- 🗓️ Donation scheduling with availability management
- 🔔 System notifications and alerts
- 🧾 Digital donation certificates (planned)
- 🌐 Multi-language support

I'm also planning to implement custom tables for:
- **Chat** between users
